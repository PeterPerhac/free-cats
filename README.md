```bash
docker-compose up &
```

this will expose postgres DB on port 54321 (to prevent clashes in case the default postgres port 5432 is already taken)


If you wish to connect to the database, the user and password are both "generic" and you can use the `./connect-to-db.sh` script assuming you have `psql` postgres client installed.
